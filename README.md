# Draft Blog based on Docusaurus

Hello World project to demo a draft blog based on Docusaurus.

Blog up and running at: https://dubzzz.github.io/draft-blog

## Create a new blog post

Create a new directory called `yyyy-mm-dd-slug-name` and put a `index.md` or `index.mdx` within it.

The `slug-name` part will be used to define the URL for this article.

Your file should start by:

```md
---
title: Name
authors: [github-handle1, github-handle2]
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

Any asset belonging to the blog post must be stored within the directory corresponding to the post.
